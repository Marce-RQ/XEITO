## Current Testing Scope

**Application Under Test**: https://www.xeito.app/  
**Status**: Under active development  
**Ready Sections**: Sign Up/Login, Leagues, Profile

## Testing Approach

Currently focused on **manual exploratory testing** using Playwright MCP to accelerate discovery and documentation. Automation will be considered once features stabilize.

## Quick Start

1. Review discovery phase templates in `discovery/`
2. Use exploratory test charters in `test-plans/`
3. Leverage Playwright MCP prompts in `playwright-mcp/`
4. Document findings using bug report templates in `bug-reports/`
